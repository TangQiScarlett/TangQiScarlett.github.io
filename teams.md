## OpenIoT Team

During undergraduate, my two roommates and I co-founded a tech group called **OpenIoT**. With an entrepreneurial spirit in technology, we participated in numerous innovation and entrepreneurship competitions. As of 2023, the OpenIoT team has grown to include 24 official members and has accumulated a total of six national-level competition awards.

<br>If you are interested in the IoT, robotics, or AIGC, we welcome you to [join OpenIoT](https://fzuiot.site/english/).
