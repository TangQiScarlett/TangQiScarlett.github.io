## Research Interests

- Religious studies: ritual, space, body
- Medical Pluralism & Stigma of Disease
- Gender and sexual orientation mobility
- Southeast Asian cultures: diet, health and social inequality

My master's thesis revolved around a year-long field study of cancer patients in China, ultimately presenting *a dynamic picture of cancer patients' practice of Daoist concepts through qigong practice*, and summarising the characteristics of the diversity of belief concepts and medical treatment choices of cancer patients through the focus on the body. The thesis won the *Outstanding Thesis Award* from the School of Social Sciences at Tsinghua University. I am currently conducting fieldwork on Catholic rituals and practices in everyday life in the Philippines, where the body and space are also two of the research concerns. In addition, I will also focus on the tension between *traditional South Asian culture and the development of modern industries*, especially e-commerce logistics, as a focus of deeper cultural description.
